Yes
Explanation 0
We perform delete operations to reduce string to hacker . Next, we perform append operations (i.e.,
r , a , n, and k ), to get hackerrank . Because we were able to convert to by performing exactly
operations, we print Yes .

solution:

string appendAndDelete(string s, string t, int k) {
int n1 = s.length();
int n2 = t.length();
int key=0,i=0;
while(i<n1 && i<n2){
if(s[i]==t[i])
{
i++;
continue;
}
else
break;
}
key = (n1-i)+(n2-i);
if(k<key)
return "No";
else if((k==key) || ((k-key)%2==0) || (k)>=(n1+n2))
return "Yes";
return "No";
}
